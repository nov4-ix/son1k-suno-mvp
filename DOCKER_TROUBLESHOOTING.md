# Docker Troubleshooting Guide for Son1kVers3

## Issue Encountered
Docker daemon API compatibility error:
```
request returned 500 Internal Server Error for API route and version http://%2FUsers%2Fnov4-ix%2F.docker%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock/v1.51/images/create
```

## Quick Fix - Run Locally ✅

The application is now working perfectly locally! Use this command:

```bash
cd "/Users/nov4-ix/Downloads/son1k_suno_poc_mvp_v2 2"
python3 run_local.py
```

**✅ Verified Working:**
- Frontend serves at: http://localhost:8000
- API health check: http://localhost:8000/api/health
- Song creation endpoint working with Celery
- Celery worker processing tasks correctly
- Redis integration working

## Docker Troubleshooting Steps

### 1. Restart Docker Desktop
```bash
# Method 1: Through GUI
# Quit Docker Desktop completely and restart

# Method 2: Command line
osascript -e 'quit app "Docker Desktop"'
open -a "Docker Desktop"
```

### 2. Reset Docker to Factory Defaults
1. Open Docker Desktop
2. Go to Settings (gear icon)
3. Select "Troubleshoot"
4. Click "Reset to factory defaults"
5. Wait for Docker to restart

### 3. Update Docker Desktop
```bash
# Check if update is available
brew update && brew upgrade docker

# Or download latest from:
# https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/
```

### 4. Alternative: Use Docker without Desktop
```bash
# Install Docker CLI only
brew install docker

# Use lima or colima as Docker backend
brew install colima
colima start --runtime docker
```

### 5. Check Docker Daemon
```bash
# Check if daemon is running
docker info

# Check API version compatibility
docker version

# Test basic functionality
docker run hello-world
```

## If Docker Still Doesn't Work

The application runs perfectly locally with:
- ✅ Redis (localhost:6379)
- ✅ SQLite database (son1k.db)
- ✅ All FastAPI endpoints
- ✅ Celery worker
- ✅ Frontend serving

## Production Deployment Alternatives

### 1. Use Different Container Runtime
```bash
# Install Podman as Docker alternative
brew install podman
podman machine init
podman machine start

# Use with docker-compose
pip install podman-compose
```

### 2. Deploy to Cloud
- Render.com
- Railway.app
- Fly.io
- DigitalOcean App Platform

### 3. Traditional VPS with systemd
Create systemd services for:
- FastAPI app
- Celery worker
- Redis server

## Summary

Your Son1kVers3 backend is **fully functional** and ready for production. The Docker issue is a local environment problem, not a code problem. All the backend fixes are working correctly:

✅ All imports resolved
✅ FastAPI serving frontend correctly
✅ Celery worker processing tasks
✅ Redis integration working
✅ Database integration ready
✅ CORS properly configured
